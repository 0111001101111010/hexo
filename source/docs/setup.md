After installed, execute the following command in the folder you want. Hexo will build all files you need in the target folder.

``` bash
hexo init <folder>
```

After built, here's how the folder looks like:

``` plain
|-- .gitignore
|-- _config.yml
|-- package.json
|-- source
|   |-- _posts
        |-- hello-world.md
|   |-- _drafts
|-- themes
    |-- light
```

### _config.yml

### package.json

{% code package.json %}
{
	"name": "hexo",
	"version": "0.0.1",
	"private": true,
	"engines": {
		"node": ">0.6.0",
		"npm": ">1.1.0"
	},
	"dependencies": {}
}
{% endcode %}
