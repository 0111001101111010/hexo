Introduction
------
Often a first post is banal and mundane, and I promise to deliver on that.

My name is Stanley Zheng and I'm a software developer, I strive to touch code everyday and challenge others to do the same. 
This blog is built in Hexo and using the theme 'greyshade'. 

Why Hexo?
--------
Could Pros but these might not fit you

Pros
+ Markdown
+ Written in Javascript
+ Good migration from Octopress/Jekyll/Wordpress support
+ Deployed on github
+ Lighnting fast 


Con
+ Markdown :)
+ Documention; much of it is in chinese
+ Still very new compared to other systems 
+ Live preview is something you have to hack, but there are many watchers in node

Conclusion
----
It was simple and lightning fast. I used octopress for the same reason but I would always run into trouble with migrations and new rakes. It was a hassle with different versions of ruby, and bottom line I had stopped hacking in Ruby.

It made sense for myself to switch, and find a tool that met my need. Anyway try Hexo, its easy to use and you can install it via NPM which is awesome
```[shell]

npm install -g hexo 

```
